Description:
  This script enhances the <Home> and <End> key in both normal mode and
  insert mode. 

  <Home> is enhanced to behave like in Visual C++, you can use <Home> to
  jump between the first column and the first non-space character of a
  line.

  Besides, <End> is also enhanced and can be used to jump between the last
  column and the last non-space character of a line.
